# This controller overrides the original events' controller bundled with
# dashing-rails introducing some new behavior. While the original one only
# propagate events when they happen, this version stream all the cached
# events [1] right when the connection is opened and only after that it'll
# behave like the original one, streaming events as they happen.
#
# [1] See `Dashing.send_events` at `app/analytics.rb` for more info about
# caching.
