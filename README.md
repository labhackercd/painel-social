# Painel Social *Next-Gen*

These are some playful iterations with **d3** and **React**. It may or may not
become the next version of [Painel
Social](https://github.com/labhackercd/painel-social).

To use this version, you'll need to have [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) installed
in your system. Then you can `npm install` it, `grunt install` it, and then
serve the root folder (like through `http-server`) and visit the created
server in the browser.
