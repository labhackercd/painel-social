# Painel Social *Next-Gen*

These are some playful iterations with **d3** and **React**. It may or may not
become the next version of [Painel
Social](https://github.com/labhackercd/painel-social).

To use this version, `npm install` it, serve the root folder (like through
`http-server`) and visit your server's `index.html`.
