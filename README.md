# Painel Social *Next-Gen*

These are some playful iterations with **d3** and **React**. It may or may not
become the next version of [Painel
Social](https://github.com/labhackercd/painel-social).

To use this version, you must have [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com) and
[browserify](http://browserify.org) installed globally.

Once these packages are installed, you just run `npm install` to install
everything else, then `grunt serve` to develop. Just don't touch the `build/`
directory. Instead, you must change files under `src/` and wait for the grunt
tasks to propagate your modifications to the build tree.
